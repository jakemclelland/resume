        I began coding on a Commodore 64, a console that required complex
        commands just to play games on the family TV. In 2002, my first paid
        programming job involved migrating some old FoxPro programs into C#. I
        moved on to develop many Microsoft .NET web services in C# and SQL
        Server for banking, printing, transportation and healthcare clients.

        I specialize in system-to-system integrations, such as connecting
        external mobile applications to back-end systems using web APIs. For one
        project that required syncing data between a cloud-accessible Azure SQL
        database and an IBM DB2 JD Edwards back-end mainframe, I developed a
        proprietary framework for data validation, verification, error handling,
        and automated retry/remediation processes.

        As a team player, I have frequently served as an Agile facilitator,
        Scrum Master, and technical trainer. My attention to detail and
        commitment to best practices have often led to a role as designated code
        reviewer.

        After hours, you can find me spending time in nature, hiking with my
        wife, practicing my hobby as an amateur bonsai enthusiast, collecting
        historical books, and expanding my skills in React, as well as Swift
        with Xcode.
